# What is Fargate
Fargate is a serverless compute engine that lets us run containers without provision the underlying infrastructure. Fargate works on both ECS and EKS which allow us to define the container resources like CPU, Mem, and Networking then AWS will manage to handle the infrastructure. Fargate allow us to focus more on building application. Fargate allow us to scale the container to 0 which is cost effective.

## Note
Since it severless, it also have a `cold-start` similar with AWS Lambda.
